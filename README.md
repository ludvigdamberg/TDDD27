We've created a social media applicaiton that is reddit-like. This is meant to have similar functionality to reddit, built with the MERN stack together with some usefull libraries, managed through NodeJS. Ofcourse this wont be an equal to reddit but the purpose is to create something in acceptable quality with similar basic functionality.

During the project we have updated through this gitlab, ofcourse. But also through github since we both think its smoother and are more "used" and comfortable using it. So to get a little better detail over some of the commits/pushes and commenting, please check out the github-repo which will be linked below.
